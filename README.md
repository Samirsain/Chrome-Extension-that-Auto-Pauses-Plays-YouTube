# 🎬 YouTube Auto Pause/Play – Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension **automatically pauses YouTube videos** when the Chrome tab becomes inactive (like when you're coding in VS Code), and **resumes playback** when the tab becomes active again.

Ideal for developers, students, and anyone who multitasks while watching YouTube.
